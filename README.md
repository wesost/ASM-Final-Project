CS278 Whitworth University, Scott Griffith  
Last Modified 4/4/2023  

# Important Dates:
* Final Project Plan - Due before class 4/20/2023
* Presentations - 1PM-3PM, 5/16/2023 
* Final Write up and Submission: 11PM, 5/19/2023 

# Grading and Evaluation

This is a project that is showing off your mastery of the material of this class. As a reminder this project forms __35% of your final grade__. *The work you turn in should reflect this.*

## Evaluation
You will be graded on:
- Effective use of the hardware
- Good circuit planning
- Reasonable and effective algorithmic design
- How well you demonstrate mastery
- Appropriate documentation

## Grade Breakdown

| Presentation                 |   15  |
| Reflection                   |   10  |
|  __Total__                   |  100  |

Video link to working demo: 

This demo should be a little more involved than 'just' what you did for the LMs. I am not going to be able to test your code, so this demo should fully demonstrate all the cool work you did. 

Be aware that misrepresenting your project in your video is a form of Academic Dishonesty. Your video, presentation and documentation must be transparent representations of the work you did. This is an assembler course, remember to understand the learning objectives as you put together material for this project. 

# Project Requirements

## Motivation
The goal of the final project is to show off what you have learned through the semester. Rather than give a final exam, I would rather see your ability expressed through accomplishing a goal using your skills. This document outlines the basics for the project and how it will be delivered, but you are welcome and encouraged to go above and beyond. Work beyond what is expected will be recognized and __extra points will be awarded__.

This project will be completed as either a solo project, or in teams of two. I would **highly recommend** approaching this as a team. This project needs sufficient complexity to be tackled alone. If working with in a team, both members are expected to be present when work is being done. Utilize pair programming. This is not a divide-and-conquer kind of project.

-------------------------

## Project Design and Execution

### General Project Requirements
For this project, the following requirements must be met:  
  * You must have some kind of external output
  * You must have some kind of external input
  * Your code must utilize the stack in some way (i.e. use subroutines)
  * Your code must utilize appropriate memory spaces (Registers / SRAM)

Your code will be directly evaluated.  
Your design will be evaluated via your demonstration and documentation.  
Your hardware will be evaluated via your demonstration and documentation.

All relevant information (.asm files, schematics, photos, parts list) will need to be **well organized** in your shared group-project repository.

You will likely need to purchase additional hardware for this project. I would expect most teams to spend somewhere in the range of $20-$40. You should not need to spend more than $50, unless you really want to. If the cost is an issue, please talk to Scott as soon as possible.

## Documentation

### Project Plan Proposal (Mandatory, worth 5 pts overall)

Due to the hardware requirements of this project, some work needs to be done with enough time to acquire material. Spending quality time on this is going to make the project path significantly easier.  

By the proposal due date, each group needs to submit the following to their final project repository:

* Project statement / goal
  * This does not need to be fully complete design, but should be detailed enough to understand the scope of the project
* Circuit diagram
* Bill of Material
  * This is an accounting of all the different parts you are going to need, and how many
* High-level block diagram of algorithm
  * Decide on appropriate detail to specify the overall structure of the code  

I would highly suggest passing this by me asap. The burden is on the team to find time to get feedback, not to expect anything from me. If you feel confident, you are welcome to continue without receiving feedback.

You are welcome to change these goals / designs as you get to working on the project. Be aware that 'we couldn't get the parts' or 'we burnt our X component because we didn't know how to use it' or 'controlling this was way too hard' are not good excuses for a failed project. This cannot be completed the week of finals. 

-------------------------

### Project Documentation

By the end of finals week, each team needs to turn in a **well organized repository**. In this repository you will include:
* Final (actual, not planned) circuit diagrams
* Memory Space Map
  * how is your program using SRAM?
  * are there important registers to the operation of your program?
* Block diagram / flowchart / function map of process
  * you can decide on form, but it needs to directly relate to the code as written
* Manual for Use
  * Pretend you are making a product for someone who knows nothing about your code. How do they interact with your project
* Accounting of assumptions
  * Think deeply about this, it is probably much more than 'nothing'
* Works cited
  * Be sure to include links to relevant data sheets
* Fully commented code
  * I should have no issue glancing at your .asm file(s) and understand what is going on
  * Every instruction needs some comment clarifying purpose

-------------------------

## Presentation

During our finals time slot we will doing demos and presentations. Each team will be given `120mins / (num_teams+1)` amount of time. You don't need to utilize the entire time, but you will be cut off if you go over. 

At a **minimum** each presentation should:
* outline your project and justify the goal (i.e. why did you do what you did)
* demonstration your project running
  * if a live-demo is not possible, a video will suffice
* reflection on the lessons learned
  * what actionable things would you do differently next time
  * 'get to work sooner' or 'do more documentation' are not interesting, give us something that helps understand the struggle you worked on
* identify future work on the project

Make sure all group members participate in the presentation. No one wants to do a code-review, don't do that. 

-------------------------

## Reflection

Each member of the team needs to submit a personal project reflection to Scott via email (sgriffith@whitworth.edu). This email needs to be submitted **after** the final project submission, but before the end of finals week.

Your reflection should take you more than 30 minutes. You should justify all of the bellow, not just list them out. If it is obviously thrown together last minute, you will not get full points. 

You reflection should include a **minimum** of:
* Argument for evaluation outcome (i.e. what grade do you think you deserve?)
* Reflection on the process
  * What went well?
  * What didn't go well?
  * What would you change if you did this project again?
* Favorite part of the project? What do you feel really good about?
* (if in a team) How did your partner do? 
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of them?
* (if in a team) What is your evaluation of how good of a teammate you were?
* Any thoughts on how I (as the instructor) can better prepare, set-up or execute the final project in the future?
