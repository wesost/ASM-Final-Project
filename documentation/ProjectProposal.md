## Description:
    THE GRAND IDEA: 
        For this final is to create a reputation monitor. Information will be retrieved from social media platforms that track various metrics, hashtags, or dislikes. The data would then be put through a validity checker to give us an accuracy rating or score. The lights on a Neo pixel strip will then be programmed using the score once it has passed through our ATmega chip, acting as a form of dynamic pie chart.

    BACK UP PLAN: (Talked to Scott about this i will fill you in in person)
       If the web scraping turns out to be a more difficult problem than we have time to solve for the actual final, we intend to slightly abstract the problem as a backup plan. In light of this, our strategy is to create a weather monitor that will allow us to retrieve the status of the current temperature and, based on whether it is rising or lowering within a selected time frame, cause the neo pixels to change color.
